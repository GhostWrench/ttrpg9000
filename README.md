# TTRPG-9000

The TTRPG-9000 is a handheld electronic dice rolling for table top RPGs. It
allows the user to select NdM to roll and shows the result of each individual
roll as well as the total. A psuedo random number generator is seeded/updated
via both the clock and user interactions with the board making for good 
randomness in the output.
