# Note found in the study of Jarland, junior historian of Arcanix before his disapearance

## A revised history of the battle of Cuuva Alta

### Background

Many accounts of the destruction of the Cuuva Alta fortess and the strange cult
of artificers that inhabited it are short, clear cut and written with a black
and white authority that is indicative of an official communication by the 
Empire of Riedra. While this event appears at first to be similar to any one of 
the many rebellious factions Riedra has crushed, there are subtle hints that 
this one in particular is much more historically significant.

The battle itself certainly is not very interesting. 52 ships sailed south from
Dar Qat for 2 days to reach the Cuuva Alta fortress. Within 2 hours, it's
defences were breached and the inhabitants were all killed or taken prisoner. 
The fleet returned 48 strong (only having lost 4 in the battle) within another 5 
days burdened by cargo looted from the devastated fortress. What is interesting 
about the story is the "why", why did the Empire of Riedra attack its' own 
outpost at Cuuva Alta? The offical reports of conspiring with fiends are 
unsupported by archeological evidence, while all the documents describing the 
artificers inhabiting Cuuva Alta before the battle refer to them as the "Order 
of Broken Reality", not the "Cult of Broken Reality" as they are now commonly 
refered to as. Very interesting indeed...

### Vantala, leader of the Cult of Broken Reality 

Much is known of Vantala, as many of her scholarly writing still remain. Right
up until the battle of Cuuva Alta, she was a registered research agent with the
Empire of Riedra. Her first assignment out of the academy was to study methods 
of market arbitrage in the southern outpost of Dar Qat. As mundane as the 
research was, she was excellent at it and soon gained great favor with the 
overlords of the outpost. This favor enabled her to convince the them to 
let her lead an expedition to explore further south into the harsh cold of 
Dowron's Shield for purposes that are not entirely clear.

Vantala pushed her expedition further and further south, all the while 
developing technologies that allowed them to thrive in the inhospitable climate
they found themselves in. Her scholarly writing became more and more obsessed 
with the concept of fate. She theorized that if events are determined by fate 
and not simply random then the structure that binds these events together would 
look remarkable similar to the magical weave. If true, this could allow fate to
be manipulated in a similar manner as a spell is cast, just requiring much more 
power. These writings were largely dismissed as impractical by the larger 
academic community as there is no known method for mortals to see or sense this
"tide of fate". However, Vantala thought that the extreem cold inherent to the
southern reaches of Eberron could potentially slow the tide just enough that
it would enable the creation of a powerful magical device that could translate 
thistide into symbols that could be understood. Vantala's academic writings 
revertedto their conventional and un-interesting nature about the same time that
she and her followers founded the Order of Broken Reality and in the fortress of
Cuuva Alta. But did she persist her studies in secret? 

## An 




In writings before the battle of Cuuva Alta

* Peer into the currents of fate itself
* <GroupName> Pushed further and further south on the continent of Xen'Drik in the hopes that the cold would allow them slow the tides of fate just enough to create a device which could peer into them.
* Some rudimentary artifacts obtained from trade with the Empire of Riedra hint at their facination with fate.
* <HeroName>, exiled from Dar Qat for delving too deeply into the study of fate that had consumed his Ohr Kaluun ancestors, took a company of loyal artificers, and scholars south of the city.
* Only a few of these "artificers dice" were made before the might of the Empire of Riedra was unleashed upon her strong-hold to put an end to her growing power.
* Most were destroyed, but a few managed to be smuggled out by Breland spies, ending up in market-places all over Khorvaire.
* Now exceedingly hard to find.
