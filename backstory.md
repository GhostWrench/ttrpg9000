# A letter found in a package sent to you by Jarland Lequin, before his disapearance

My dear friend,

It has been too long since we have last communicated, I wish there was more time to engage in pleasantries but I have a rather urgent matter. This package that I have sent you contains an artifact, one which may be of immense power. Please read this letter fully, it is long but contains important information about the artifact from my research and how I came to possess it. I can no longer keep it for reasons I will explain in this letter. I know you are an adept adventurer and can keep it safe, if you can unlock it's secrets it may even prove to be an invaluable tool.

## The assault on Cuuva Alta

Many accounts of the destruction of the Cuuva Alta fortess and the strange cult of artificers that inhabited it are short and written with a black and white authority that is indicative of an official communication by the Empire of Riedra. While this battle appears at first to be similar to any one of the many other Riedran battles to crush rebellious factions, there are subtle hints that this one in particular is much more historically significant.

The battle itself certainly is not very interesting. Fifty-two ships sailed south from Dar Qat for five days to reach the Cuuva Alta fortress. Then, within a day, Cuuva Alta's defences were breached and the inhabitants were all killed or taken prisoner. The fleet returned fourty-seven strong (only having lost five ships in the battle) within another fortnight, burdened by cargo looted from the devastated fortress. What is interesting about the story is the "why", why did the Empire of Riedra attack it's own outpost at Cuuva Alta? The offical reports of conspiring with fiends are unsupported by archeological evidence. Meanwhile all the documents describing the artificers inhabiting the fortress before the battle refer to them as the "Order of Broken Reality", not the "Cult of Broken Reality" as they are now commonly refered to.

## Vantala, leader of the Cult of Broken Reality 

To understand the Cult of Broken Reality, one needs to know about their leader, Vantala. Much is known of Vantala, as many of her scholarly writing still remain. Right up until the battle of Cuuva Alta, she was a registered research agent with the Empire of Riedra. Her first assignment out of the academy was to study methods of market arbitrage in the southern outpost of Dar Qat. As mundane as this research was, she was excellent at it and soon gained great favor with the overlords of the outpost. This favor enabled her to convince them to let her lead an expedition to explore further south into the harsh cold of Dowron's Shield in an attempt to discovered magics the might hide there.

As Vantala pushed this expedition further and further south, her scholarly writing became more and more obsessed with the concept of fate. She theorized that if all events could be pre-determined by fate, the structure that binds these events together could be described and quantified, much like wizards have long described the magical weave in their writings. She called this structure the "tide of fate". Her ideas were largely dismissed by the larger academic community as overly theoretical but Vantala thought that the extreem cold inherent to the southern reaches of Eberron could potentially slow the tide of fate just enough that it could be studied and potentially influenced by a powerful magical device that she dubbed "Artificer's Dice". There is no convincing evidence that Vantala or her cult ever succeeded creating a such a device, and I would have believed this if it hadn't been for recent events.

## The drunken fortune teller

I ocassionally attend shows put on by travelling "mystics" in Lower Menthis. Not that I believe in any of their cheap parlor tricks, it is just, a guilty pleasure. Two nights ago I witnessed an older, very handsome half-elf calling himself "Nevelastrand" do things that I could not explain. He walked around the streets of the Firelight district predicting the outcome of card games, fights and even other street entertainer's shows, much to the delight of the crowd that followed him everywhere. Not once did he predict the wrong outcome and each time he made a prediction he refered to a small oval device with strange shifting numeric symbols displayed on it. While I tried to tell myself what I was seeing was a trick, I never did succeed in fully convincing myself.

As luck would have it, after the show as I was enjoying a late night drink at my favorite pub when Nevelastrand walked in with a companion. They were both very drunk and in intense, flirtatous conversation with each other. So naturally, I used my magic earring to eavesdrop. Nevelastrand was clearly trying to impress this companion of his and started telling a far-fetched tale. He claimed that when he younger he was a spy on one of the fifty-two ships that assaulted Cuuva Alta. He also claimed that only four ships were destroyed, not five and that the fifth had actually been comandeered by him and other operatives and brought back to Throneport. He then told his enraptured companion that the small oval device was taken from Cuuva Alta, failing to mention exactly how he got a hold of it. I almost let out an audible gasp, did he actually have an artifact from Cuuva Alta? Perhaps even the Artificer's Dice? It would explain how he had made so many acurate preditions earlier that night.

If the device held by Nevelastrand was truly the Artificer's Dice of legend, then it held great importance for academic research. Therefore I resolved to obtain it from him, one way or another. I waited for the pair to finish their drinks and leave the bar, downed my own drink and tailed them out of the door. As the pair walked down the street I managed to lift the device out of his jacket pocket with a my mage hand and drop it to the ground. Neither Nevelastrand or his companion noticed in their drunken state and I swiftly picked it up and started walking back to my quarters. 

## My own investigation

My days since obtaining the device have been filled with an exploration of the device controls, there is a small power switch on the upper right hand side and once powered up the symbols that appear in the middle can be manipulated by either turning the two knobs in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction or by pressing down on them. I have yet to make sense of the symbols and numbers that appear, but I do believe they contain a treasure of information.

My nights however, have been filled with some variation of the same dream where I hear a voice telling me to bring the device to Dar Jin in Sarlona and when I try to question why, the device starts burning in my hands. A crude message from the Dreaming Dark no doubt. For this reason I can no longer keep the device safe as I believe my possession of it has made me a target to powers I cannot fend off.

You are the most capable adventurer that I know, can I trust you to protect the artifact and continue unlocking it's secrets?

Sincerely,
